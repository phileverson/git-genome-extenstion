00000-Phil's Project Status Tracking

To do:
- Add GA (so we can see if ppl actually use it) 
Update: GA now added, need to confirm the data is appearing analytics account, but events are firing (based on the debugger)
Update 2: GA is deginitly working, firing either a success or failure event. Doesn't seem to fire pageviews, but that's cool with me...

- Package it all up nice and tidy so that ppl can install it easily
- Find away to host it not publickly...
